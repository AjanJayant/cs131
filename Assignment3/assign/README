In this project, I was unable to test it on the lnxsrv. I got the following error when I unpacked my jar file:
[ajan@lnxsrv03 ~/cs131]$ jar -xvf hw3.jar
#
# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# pthread_getattr_np
# An error report file with more information is saved as:
# /w/ugrad.17/cs/ajan/cs131/hs_err_pid10142.log

Even when I copied the files into the server and tried to compile them, I got the following errors:
[ajan@lnxsrv03 ~/cs131]$ javac *.java
#
# There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
# pthread_getattr_np
# An error report file with more information is saved as:
# /w/ugrad.17/cs/ajan/cs131/hs_err_pid10107.log

As such, I tried to test Jpigz, pigz and gzip on my own machine. Unfortunately, I ran out of virtual memory:

Test 1

Using: dd if=/dev/zero of=input bs=1024 count=0 seek=1024

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time Java Jpigz < input.file > jpigz.gz

real	0m0.333s
user	0m0.458s
sys	0m0.154s

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time /Users/ajanjayant/Documents/cs131/pigz-2.2.5/pigz < input.file > pigz.gz

real	0m0.075s
user	0m0.019s
sys	0m0.006s

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time gzip < input.file > pigz.gz

real	0m0.045s
user	0m0.010s
sys	0m0.003s

Test 2

Using: Using: dd if=/dev/zero of=input bs=10240 count=0 seek=1024

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time Java Jpigz < input2.file > jpigz.gz

real	0m1.399s
user	0m1.972s
sys	0m1.131s

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time gzip < input2.file > g.gz

real	0m0.087s
user	0m0.082s
sys	0m0.005s

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time /Users/ajanjayant/Documents/cs131/pigz-2.2.5/pigz < input2.file > pigz2.gz

real	0m0.096s
user	0m0.158s
sys	0m0.007s

Test 3

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ vim output3.txt

Make me a man! A man who is Ajan. Where no man has gone before.
Ever!

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time Java Jpigz < output3.txt > jpigz.gz

real	0m0.217s
user	0m0.250s
sys	0m0.037s

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time gzip < output3.txt > g.gz

real	0m0.003s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.002s

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ time /Users/ajanjayant/Documents/cs131/pigz-2.2.5/pigz < output3.txt > pigz3.gz

real	0m0.005s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.003s

Noticebly, Jpigz takes much more time time. This could be because of the time taken to create objects and because the system calls might slow down the system.

I tested the databases like this:

Ajans-MacBook-Pro:assign ajanjayant$ gzip -d < jpigz.gz > outputNew.txt
